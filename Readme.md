To start out with the refactor part of the sprint, I was able to get everything done and update the tests so that they didnt fail with the new information. When it came to the updating data part, I attempted to get new items into qtlistwidget or anything else to get it to display in the gui, but I couldnt seem to get that to work. When I change the table, I could only get the title to change and not the data. You can see the other table if you change the table in the class to the other one before running. The occupation code is ascending in the gui that boots on startup, but again I couldnt figure out how to change the table info with buttons. I struggled to display both tables together in the gui as well, which made it hard to do any of the data analysis parts and tests for that. I have included a working test for what I could get done with the reloading part. I have included a word document titled "BCraineGuiTesting.docx" and that includes my plan for gui tests with pictures. Lastly I managed to fix the dependency issues in Dev Ops to get the build to work with PYSide6.
