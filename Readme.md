To start out with the refactor part of the sprint, I was able to get everything done and update the tests so that they didnt fail with the new information. When it came to the updating data part, I attempted to be able to change the table and update the data at the same time, so that you can go back and forth as it updates. But when I change the table, I could only get the title to change and not the data. You can see the other table if you change the table in the class to the other one before running. The occupation code is ascending in the gui that boots on startup, but again I couldnt figure out how to change the table info with buttons. I struggled to display both tables together in the gui as well, which made it hard to do any of the data analysis parts and tests for that. However, I have included a word document titled "BCraineGuiTesting.docx" and that includes my plan for gui tests with pictures. Lastly I managed to fix the dependency issues in Dev Ops to get the build to work with PYSide6.
